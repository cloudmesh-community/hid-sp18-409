\section{Introduction}

A crime is generally defined as an act punishable by law and is one of the 
dangerous factors for any country\cite{hid-sp18-409-agarwal2013crime}. It is 
impossible to find a country with a 
crime- free society due to complex causes such as poverty, parental neglect, 
low self-esteem, alcohol, drug abuse and 
etc~\cite{hid-sp18-409-bharathi2014survey, hid-sp18-409-kiani2015analysis}. 
Inspired by the big data revolution, the historical way of crime solving and 
prevention has greatly influenced and improved by the help of state-of-the-art 
data analytic tools and machine learning research. Law enforcement officers 
have started involving more data analytic expertises to speedup the crime 
solving process highlighting that, it is an interdisciplinary research area.

According to Chicago Police Department, crime prevention is important and much 
more difficult to handle than crime solving for law enforcement 
agencies~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-cpd}. Law enforcement officers could identify 
crime prone areas or suspicious activities 
even before a crime is committed with the aid of pattern recognition and 
big data analysis~\cite{hid-sp18-409-nath2006crime, hid-sp18-409-gera2014city}. 
According to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and 
Chicago Police Department (CPD), whenever a crime was committed somewhere, more 
crimes are likely to be occurred in a nearby area, and the patterns of those 
criminal activities could be identified through big data 
analysis~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-cpd, hid-sp18-409-www-lapd}. However, 
crime prevention could be so much effective if there is an easy way to check 
the crime prone areas so that people could be aware the of crime prone 
areas.

As inspired by the requirement to raise the awareness of crime prone areas, we 
implement a location based crime search website where people can find 
crimes happened near a particular geographical location (in a vicinity area) 
for a given GPS coordinates. For this project, we have selected a dataset which 
includes the crime information from 2001 to current date in Chicago 
city~\cite{hid-sp18-409-www-data.gov}. We further analyze this crime dataset 
using the crime type and tries to identify the correlation between crime 
types for a particular geographical area. One applicational use of this project 
would be a user trying to buy a new house and he may like to do a background 
search on criminal activities around the geographical area for safety concerns.

The organization of this project report is as follows. In section II, a 
literature review on existing crime data analyses and crime reporting web 
services are presented. Section III provides a methodology followed in this 
project while section IV elaborates the results and discussion. A summary about 
the project paper is provided in section V.
